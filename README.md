# Project Proposal

# Project Title: Food Nearby

# What and Why:

Almost everyone likes to try new food! But, not everyone knows what new foods they would like and deciding what resteraunt to go to remains a challenge for people who don't want to waste money on food they potentially won't like.

Food Nearby aims to be an application that can take someone's favorite foods and reccomend either reteraunts nearby that serve that food, but, more improtantly will reccomend new foods to try based on the user's taste.


# For Who:

Anyone who is willing and wanting to try new foods and expand their tastes 

# How/Scope:

- User Profiles/ Food Logger: Each user will create a profile which is where people will be able to log what their current tastes are and see various reccomendations.

- Home Page: This will be where foods that are trending globally on the app will be displayed, this will be displayed to everyone regardless of their specific tastes are, if we were looking at this from a business standpoint, companies could also choose to advertise here.

- Implentation of the Google Maps API: The Maps API allows developers to find and access information about resteraunts nearby the user, this is how we will be using the information submitting by the user to find new places/food for them to eat.
