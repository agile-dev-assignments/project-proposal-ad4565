# Project Proposal

# Project Title: Food Nearby

# What and Why:

Food Nearby aims to be an application that can take someone's favorite foods and reccomend either reteraunts nearby that server that food, but, more improtantly will reccomend new foods to try based on the user's taste.

# For Who:

Anyone who is willing and wanting to try new foods and expand their tastes 

# How/Scope:

This may sound like a daunting project but the Google Maps API allows developers to see resteraunts nearby the current user but also the information of those resteraunts, so,by collecting certain user data that they input into the application we will be able to use the Google API to find new/similar foods that resteraunts are serving.
